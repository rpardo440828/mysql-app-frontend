https://collectionwebsite.netlify.app/

# Tech Used
This website uses React JS for the front end, Node JS for the backend, and MySQL for storage. It also uses cookie-parser and jwt in order to hash the user passwords stored, and to save access tokens. It was deployed using Netlify, and Heroku.

# Current State
This website allows you to create your very own book, movie, and tv show collections. It is able to do all CRUD operations while also having login capabilities.  Currently user has to input title, description, and png image of the items.

# Future State
Instead of inputting the title, description, and cover image in yourself, the website will use API`s to retrieve data of books, movies and shows. This will be more user friendly as you will beb able to just search for a specific item and add to your collection.

# Example
Please use the credentials below to view an already created set of collections. Feel Free to play around with them.
